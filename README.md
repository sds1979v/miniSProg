# How to run/compile this project?

It's already compiled for Windows!


---------
# How to use it?

When you start up the application it will look into its current folder to find 
the xc3sprog execuatable, if it is not there then you have to tell it where to 
find that file (it should be in the xc3sProg sub directory). Next you need to select the 
bit file (must have ".bit" extension) then click on 'Program'. The details 
console will show the the result, check it to see if it was successful or it 
there was any error.
